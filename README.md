# Grid Rogue-Like Game (TBD)
A grid-based roguelike adventure where survival is the core!

## Gameplay Mechanics

Resource Management: Explore to find and collect vital Food to replenish your Hunger and Health packs to restore your well-being.
Dungeon Exploration: Discover interconnected rooms and move between them using Stairs. Each room presents new challenges and opportunities.
Objective: Your ultimate goal is to locate the mysterious Key and unlock the Exit Door to escape the dungeon and win the game!
